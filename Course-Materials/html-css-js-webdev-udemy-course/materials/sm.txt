css: cascading style sheet

cascading: flow

css Layers: refers to applying the z-index property to elements that overlap with each other

3 types of coloring: hexadecimal code, rgb absolute, keywords
#000000 rgb(0,0,0)      black
#FF0000 rgb(255,0,0)    red
#00FF00 rgb(0,255,0)    green
#0000FF rgb(0,0,255)    blue
also color can be passed in hsl from -  hue saturation and lightcolor

Padding:
when we have used padding 15 pixels that mean it will be 15 pixels from all the four side.

But if I will specify like 10 pixels and spaced 2%, that means from top and bottom it's going to be 10 pixel, 
and from left and right it is going to be two percent.

Similarly, if I pass three different values, that means the top is going to take the first one.
The bottom is going to take the third one and the left and right will shear the middle value.

positioning: abosolue - particular x&y axis value, relative - coordinates but relative to its original positioning, 
             Fixed - fixed to particular position.

selectors in css:
    name selector - name of a paricular tag eg: h1,a,p
    class selector - give class name for a div and style using class name
    id selector - give id to particular div and style the unique id styling
    universal selector - body or complete doc styling
