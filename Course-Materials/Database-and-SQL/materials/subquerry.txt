Subquery is a query inside a query. 
A subquery should be enclosed in parenthesis and can be used in SELECT, FROM, WHERE and HAVING clauses.
Subquery in SELECT and FROM clause are not used often. 
Subqueries in WHERE and HAVING clauses are classified into the following:-
1. Independent subquery
2. Correlated subquery

In an independent subquery, the inner queries and outer queries are independent of each other. 
You can run an inner query and inspect its result independent of the outer query. 
Independent subquery is further classified into  
1. single row 
2. multiple row 
types depending upon the number of rows returned.
