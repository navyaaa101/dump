CASE statement can be used in SELECT clause to conditionally assign values to a computed attribute. 
It can also be used with WHERE, GROUP BY etc. 
CASE statement has two different syntax styles: Simple CASE expression and Searched CASE expression. 
Both of them are similar to if else statement in Java.

(1) Simple CASE expression :
Pseudo code:

if designation == 'SE'
    salary = salary * 1.2
else if designation == 'SSE'
    salary = salary * 1.1
else
    salary = salary * 1.05

The CASE statement goes through conditions and returns a value when the first condition is met (like an IF-THEN-ELSE statement). 
So, once a condition is true, it will stop reading and return the result. If no conditions are true, it returns the value in the ELSE clause.

We can use the first syntax form when all conditions check for equality against a single column.

(2) Searched CASE expression :
Pseudo code:

if marks >= 85
    grade = 'Excellent'
else if marks >= 65
    grade = 'Good'
else
    grade = 'Poor'

We can use the second syntax form to compare different conditions.

NOTE: ELSE is optional. If ELSE is omitted and no condition is true, then NULL is returned by CASE.
