In order to display the rows in sorted order, SQL has one clause called the ORDER BY clause.
Order By clause is used to sort the result of a query in a particular order. 
Before we understand the syntax of ORDER BY, let us understand the sorting process on tabular data. 
Data in a single column can be sorted in ascending or descending order.
We can also sort data by multiple columns. 
In such case data is sorted on the primary (first) column first. 
Sorting on the secondary column happens only when multiple rows have the same value in the primary column. 
The sort order can be different for the two columns i.e. primary can be sorted in ascending and secondary in descending and vice-versa. 
This two column sorting mechanism can be extended to any number of columns.
ORDER BY must be used to specify the columns on which data has to be sorted and the sort order i.e. ascending or descending. 
Rows are sorted in ascending order if sort order is not specified. 
DESC should be used to sort the rows in descending order. 
ORDER BY clause must be the last clause and can be used only in SELECT statement. 
The sort order only applies to the query result i.e. the underlying data in the table is not sorted.
An important point to note is that sorting of rows in the result is guaranteed only on columns specified in the ORDER BY clause. 
If multiple rows have same value for columns in ORDER BY clause then they can appear in any order.
