CROSS Join is also referred to as Cartesian Product. 
A CROSS join with m rows in table A and n rows in table B will always produce m * n rows. 
Essentially it combines each row from the first table with each row of the second table. 
A cross join is rarely used as it mostly produces lot of meaningless data. 
However it is useful to understand the concept of other joins

INNER Join is the most frequently used JOIN. 
It matches the records from both tables based on the join predicate and returns only the matched rows. 
For ease of understanding one can think that first a Cartesian Product is created and then all the rows that do not meet the join condition are dropped from the result. 
Inner join also has a short hand syntax given its wide use.
The query is evaluated using a two-step process:
Step 1. Two tables are joined using join condition and resultset is evaluated
Step 2. Filter condition in WHERE clause is applied on all the rows of the resultset to give the final result
