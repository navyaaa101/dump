GROUP BY must always be after the WHERE clause otherwise aggregate functions will be calculated wrongly.
Having must always be after Group by as it filters records based on aggregate functions calculated during GROUP BY evaluation
SELECT clause must be evaluated after Group By and Having because displaying attributes not used in GROUP BY are not allowed in SELECT clause. 
It can only filter columns from the grouped resultset
ORDER BY must always be the last step in query execution as it depends on input from other clauses.

Do’s for Group by and Having clauses:
GROUP BY clause should contain all non-aggregate columns that are present in SELECT clause
GROUP BY clause should be mandatory when there is a list of aggregate and non-aggregate columns in SELECT statement
Whenever nested aggregate columns appear in the SELECT clause, GROUP BY clause should be mandatorily used
HAVING cannot be written without the GROUP BY clause in the query
Aggregate column condition(s) should always be written along with the HAVING clause and not with the WHERE clause

Don’ts for Group by and Having clauses:
Columns from the list of the SELECT clause should not be skipped in the GROUP BY clause. 
    However, you can add an extra non-aggregate column which is not present in the SELECT to the GROUP BY clause
GROUP BY clause should not contain any aggregate columns
Aliased name given for the column should not be used in GROUP BY clause
HAVING clause should not contain non-aggregate columns which are not present in the GROUP BY clause
If the query does not adhere to these points, either it gives syntax error or it may result in a wrong output.
