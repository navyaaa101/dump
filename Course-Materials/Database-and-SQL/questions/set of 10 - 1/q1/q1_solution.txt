To identify the candidate keys, primary keys, and foreign keys for the given relations in the banking application, let's analyze each table.

### 1. Customer
**Attributes:**
- CustId
- Name
- Address
- EMail
- ContactNumber
- AcctNumber
- AcctType
- OpenDate

**Candidate Keys:**
- CustId (Each customer has a unique customer ID.)

**Primary Key:**
- CustId

**Foreign Keys:**
- AcctNumber (This should reference the primary key of another table which holds account details, but since it's not provided, we'll consider it later if needed.)
- AcctType (References `AccountType.AcctType`)

### 2. AccountType
**Attributes:**
- AcctType
- MinBalance

**Candidate Keys:**
- AcctType (Each account type has a unique type identifier.)

**Primary Key:**
- AcctType

**Foreign Keys:**
- None (This table is standalone with no dependencies.)

### 3. Transaction
**Attributes:**
- TId
- TranType
- TDate
- ChequeNum
- AccNum
- Amount
- CustId

**Candidate Keys:**
- TId (Each transaction has a unique transaction ID.)

**Primary Key:**
- TId

**Foreign Keys:**
- AccNum (This should reference the primary key of another table which holds account details, but since it's not provided, we'll consider it later if needed.)
- CustId (References `Customer.CustId`)

### Summary of Keys

**Customer:**
- **Primary Key:** CustId
- **Foreign Keys:** 
  - AcctType (References `AccountType.AcctType`)

**AccountType:**
- **Primary Key:** AcctType
- **Foreign Keys:** None

**Transaction:**
- **Primary Key:** TId
- **Foreign Keys:**
  - CustId (References `Customer.CustId`)

### Additional Considerations
- The `AcctNumber` in the `Customer` and `Transaction` tables should reference a separate `Account` table which could look something like this:
  ```sql
  Account (AcctNumber, AcctType, OpenDate, CustId)
  ```
- The `AcctType` in the `Account` table would reference `AccountType.AcctType`.
- If `Account` table is created, the `Customer` table would no longer need the `AcctType` field, as it would be determined by joining with the `Account` table.

### Revised Schema with Account Table
#### Customer
```sql
Customer (CustId, Name, Address, EMail, ContactNumber)
PRIMARY KEY (CustId)
```

#### Account
```sql
Account (AcctNumber, AcctType, OpenDate, CustId)
PRIMARY KEY (AcctNumber)
FOREIGN KEY (AcctType) REFERENCES AccountType (AcctType)
FOREIGN KEY (CustId) REFERENCES Customer (CustId)
```

#### AccountType
```sql
AccountType (AcctType, MinBalance)
PRIMARY KEY (AcctType)
```

#### Transaction
```sql
Transaction (TId, TranType, TDate, ChequeNum, AccNum, Amount, CustId)
PRIMARY KEY (TId)
FOREIGN KEY (AccNum) REFERENCES Account (AcctNumber)
FOREIGN KEY (CustId) REFERENCES Customer (CustId)
```

This setup ensures that all foreign key constraints are properly defined and maintain referential integrity across the relations.
