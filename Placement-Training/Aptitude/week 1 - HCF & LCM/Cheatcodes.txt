HCF & LCM:
    HCF:
        Highest common factor.
        Find the factors of the number and their highest number if the HCF
        Also called as GCD: Greatest Common Divisor.

        Factorize till we obtain down to non common factorizable numbers for all the numbers.
        Multiply all the factors and hence obtained number is the HCF.

        Observation is also a key to find the HCF.

    LCM:
        Least Commmon Multiple.
        Factorize till we obtain down to 1 for all the numbers.
        Multiply all the factors and hence obtained number is the LCM.

        Observation is also a key to find the LCM.
    
LCM fraction = LCM Numerator/HCF Denominator.

HCF fraction = HCF Numerator/LCM Denominator.

Greatest -> HCF

Least, Total -> LCM

For remainder leaving problem check for a relation with the remainders ad then subtract it from the LCM.

LCM*HCF = multiple of the numbers.

For sum of numbers and HCF/LCM problems -> Create pairs and check the condition.
