Angle of elevation: down angle

Angle of depression: up angle

Tree, Wall, Building, Tower - consider perpendicular

shadow cast - 90 degree, until given otherwise

Banks of the river, parallel roads - consider two ends of the base

1/sin(theeta) = coasec(theeta)
1/cos(theeta) = sec( theeta)
1/tan(theeta) = cot(theeta)

sin -> 0, 1/2, 1/root(2), root(3)/2,1
tan -> 0. 1/root(3), 1, root(3), unidentified

VBODMAS -> Vinculum Bar, Brackets, of, division, Multiplication, Addition, Substraction

Brackets -> (), {}, []

Squares and Cubes -> Squares till 30 should be known, Cubes till 10 should be known.

Formulae -> Basic Formulae related to quadratic equations Squares and Cubes.

Simplifying series -> divide, 95% of the fractions get divided by first 20 numbers.
