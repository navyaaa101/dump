Trains:
    Speed, distance, time s=d/t

    length of train -> included distance travelled
    legth of any object(man, car, pole) -> 0

    Normal speed -> with relation to stationary object
    relative speed -> with relation to moving object

    for two objects with different directions -> relative speed = addition
    for two objects with same directions -> relative speed = subtraction

    total distance travelled for tow trains in different directions = addition of length of two trains

    dst formula is the only formula to be used to calculate all the train related problems

    Check for one same value and then use the dst formula

    Consider relative speed if more than 2 or 2 objects are invloved.

Speed, Distance, Time:
    distance = speed * time.

    4 types of sums:    
        distance sqame
        Speed same
        Time same
        Average speed

    Average speed = total distance/ total time.
