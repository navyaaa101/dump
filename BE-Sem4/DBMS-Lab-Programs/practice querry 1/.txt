Consider the following Schema for order database
 salesman(salesman_id,name,city,commission)
 customer(customer_id,cust_name,city,grade,salesman_id)
 orders(ord_no,purchase_amt,ord_date,customer_id,salesman_id)

write SQL querries to
1.count the customers with grades above banglore's average
2.find the name and numbers of all salesman who had more than one customer
3.list all salesman and indicate those who have and dont have customers in their cites(use UNION operation)
4.create a view that finds the salesman who has the customer with the highest order of a day
5.demonstrate the DELETE operation by removing salesman with id 1000, all his orders must also be added
