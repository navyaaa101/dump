1. Using Keil software, observe the various Registers, Dump, CPSR, with a simple Assembly Language Programs (ALP). 
2. Develop and simulate ARM ALP for Data Transfer, Arithmetic and Logical operations (Demonstrate with the help of a suitable program). 
3. Develop an ALP to multiply two 16-bit binary numbers. 
4. Develop an ALP to find the sum of first 10 integer numbers. 
5. Develop an ALP to find the largest/smallest number in an array of 32 numbers. 
6. Develop an ALP to count the number of ones and zeros in two consecutive memory locations. 
7. Simulate a program in C for ARM microcontroller using KEIL to sort the numbers in ascending/descending order using bubble sort. 
8. Simulate a program in C for ARM microcontroller to find factorial of a number.  
9. Simulate a program in C for ARM microcontroller to demonstrate case conversion of characters from upper to lowercase and lower to uppercase.
