Algorithm Knapsack(m, n, w, p, x):
    i/p: m is the capacoty of Knapsack, n is the number of objects, w and p are weights and profits.
    o/p: maximum profit
    for i <- i to n do
        x[i] <- 0
        weight <- 0
        while weight < w do
            i <- the best remaining object
            if weight+w[i] <= w then
                x[i] <- 1
                weight <- weight + w[i]
            else
                x[i] <-(w - weight)/w[i]
                weight <- w
    return x
