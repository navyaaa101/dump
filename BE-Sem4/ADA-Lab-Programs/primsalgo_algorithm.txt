Algorithm: Prim's Algorithm
    Input: A connected, undirected graph represented by a cost adjacency matrix a with n vertices.
    Output: MST and its total cost.

    1. Initialize arrays `visited` and `sel`.
    2. Set the source vertex (e.g., vertex 0) as visited.
    3. count <- 0
    sum <- 0
    k <- 0

    4. while count < n-1 do
        min <- 999
        for i <- 0 to n-1 do
            for j <- 0 to n-1 do
                if visited[i] = 1 and visited[j] != 1 and a[i][j] < min then
                    min <- a[i][j]
                    u <- i
                    v <- j
            end for
        end for

        sel[k][0] <- u
        sel[k][1] <- v
        sum <- sum + a[u][v]
        visited[v] <- 1
        k <- k + 1
        count <- count + 1
    end while

    5. if sum < 999 then
        print "Spanning Tree Exists."
        print "Sum of MST: ", sum
        print "Selected Edges: "
        for i <- 0 to n-2 do
            print sel[i][0], "--", sel[i][1]
        end for
    else
        print "Spanning Tree does not exist."
    end if
