Algorithm HuffmanCoding(charFreq)
    Input: A list of characters and their frequencies.
    Output: A dictionary of characters and their corresponding Huffman codes.
    
    Initialize Priority Queue:
        Create a priority queue and insert all characters along with their frequencies as nodes.

    Construct the Huffman Tree:
        While the priority queue contains more than one node:
            Extract the two nodes with the smallest frequencies.
            Create a new internal node with these two nodes as children and with a frequency equal to the sum of their frequencies.
            Insert the new node back into the priority queue.
        The remaining node in the queue is the root of the Huffman Tree.
    
    Generate Huffman Codes:
        Traverse the Huffman Tree from the root to the leaves, assigning a binary code to each character. Moving left assigns a '0' and moving right assigns a '1'.
