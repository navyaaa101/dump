Initialization:
    The input matrix A is used to represent the adjacency matrix of the graph.

Triple Nested Loop:
    The algorithm iterates over each possible pair of vertices (i, j) and considers each vertex k as an intermediate vertex.
    If there is a path from i to k and from k to j, then there is a path from i to j.

Update Matrix:
    Update A[i][j] to 1 if there is an intermediate vertex k such that A[i][k] and A[k][j] are both 1.

Result:
    The final matrix A represents the transitive closure of the graph.

                A[i][j] <- A[i][j] OR (A[i][k] AND A[k][j])
