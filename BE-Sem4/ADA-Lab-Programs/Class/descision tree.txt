Model Training:
    For classification, DecisionTreeClassifier is used.
    For regression, DecisionTreeRegressor is used.
    The model is trained on the training dataset (X_train and y_train).

Prediction:
    raining, the model can be used to make predictions on new data (X_test).

Evaluation:
    Metrics like accuracy (for classification) or mean squared error (for regression) are used to evaluate the model's performance.
