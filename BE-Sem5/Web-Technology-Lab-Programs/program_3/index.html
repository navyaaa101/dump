						<p>
							The <span>Toyota Supra</span> (Japanese: ???·????, Hepburn: Toyota Supura) is a sports car and grand tourer manufactured by the Toyota Motor Corporation beginning in 1978. 
							The name "supra" is derived from the Latin prefix, meaning "above", "to surpass" or "go beyond"
							The first generation of the Supra was based largely upon the Toyota Celica liftback, but was longer by 129.5 mm (5.10 in). 
							The doors and rear section were shared with the Celica but the front panels were elongated to accommodate the Inline-6 instead of the Celica's 4-cylinder engine
